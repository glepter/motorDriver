Modular stepper motor driver

The Following project (will)contains the programming, schematics, PBC designs, of a modular stepper motor driver focused on reliability and response time, we'll be exploring different approaches to determine the best ratio of modularity-ease of use. 

The idea behind the project is the much needed standarization of a good, affordable and modular baseline for driving stepper motors of any size and power requirements. 

The project will have some sources of inspiration to try and extract the best features from the current systems to arrive at the best solution. 

I expect this journey to take some time and probably some turns, hopefully interesting ones.
